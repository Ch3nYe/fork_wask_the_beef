# How to create a fork to wash the beef? 


## create a fork to wash the beef I-python-,

We could use Python, C and Java to create a program that automates the process of washing beef with a fork. The program could take an argument such as the user input and turn it to a fork and wash the beef with the fork. Additionally, the program must print a string "mY beef" in the washing routine. The following shows the demo code of the program of creating a fork to wash the beef in Python, C and Java.


I use python language to create a fork to wash the beef,


```Python
def fork_mYfunc(arg):
    for i in range(1, len(arg)):
        for j in range(0, len(arg)-i):
            if arg[j] > arg[j+1]:
                arg[j], arg[j+1] = arg[j+1], arg[j]
                print("mY beef")
```
